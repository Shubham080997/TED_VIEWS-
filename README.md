# TED_VIEWS-
A natural language processing project to reveal linguistic features that predict a persuasive TED Talk. I webscraped every TED Talk transcript and it's metadata through 2017 and then used decision trees, random forest regressors, and linear regression to find key predictors of persuasive ratings by viewers.
